# LogC
A Library for logging in C. 
Requires C99 for functionality, or extensions supporting variadic Macros and an equivalent to the vsnprintf() function.

Current status: WIP, not fully tested, use at own risk. 
Only tested on Windows 7 x64 using MinGw_w64 with GCC 7.1 so far.

Makefile is reduced to a minimum ATM.

TODOs:
- Test on Linux
- Improve Tests in general
- Improve Documentation
- Improve Makefile?
