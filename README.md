# LogC
A Library for logging in C. 
Requires C99 for functionality, or extensions supporting variadic Macros and an equivalent to the vsnprintf() function.

Current status: WIP, not fully tested, use at own risk. Compiles on Windows and Linux using GCC.
Tested on Windows 7 x64 using MSYS2/MinGw_w64 with GCC 7.1 and on Linux Mint 19 using GCC 7.3.

Makefile is reduced to a minimum for the testing ATM, I recommend to use the LogC.c- and .h file in your project directly.

TODOs:
- Improve Tests in general
- Improve Documentation
